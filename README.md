# Machine Learning

This is where I code, push, document and improve my machine-learning skills.

## Goals

One of my personal goals for 2019 is to get deeper knowledge and skills in python, data-science and machine-learning.
The overall plan is to:

- follow several machine-learning courses starting back to the very basics
- develop and push code into this repository
- create utilitary libraries for repetitive menial tasks / boilerplate
- document progress and key kowledge for later reviewing

## Resources

Reference courses / lessons / documentation coming from:

- [SuperDataScience Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning, ) 
- [Lazy Programmer Deep Learning Pre-requisites: Linear Regression](https://www.udemy.com/data-science-linear-regression-in-python/)
